# Game-Development-Project
This document should be a direct representation of the game. As the game grows and changes so should this document. This way everyone is on the same page for every game asset and game component. If you have an idea please try to flesh it out here.

Goals of the player:
The player must manage resources to create units and towers for defense and offense. The player must survive waves of attacks or destroy the portal/s that the waves are coming from. The player wins if either of these conditions are met.

Optional game modes/challenges:
Timed survival – continuous waves for a set time
Survival mode - defeat x number of waves

Game rules: 

Demons spawn from a portal and follow a predetermined path to attack the town in waves. The town must be defended or the player losses the game. The player can place towers on build spots along the path or create spearmen to defend the town and eventually launch an attack on the portal.

The towns health is a representation of the number of people fighting for their lives.

The magic system is based on a rock – paper – scissors concept. 

Game world description:
